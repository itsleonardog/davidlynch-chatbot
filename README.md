# David Lynch Chatbot

## Project Inspiration

This project was born from my deep admiration for David Lynch and his unique cinematic vision. As a personal passion project, I wanted to create an experience that captures the distinctive atmosphere found in Lynch's works like Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive, and Blue Velvet. His surreal visual style, use of striking color contrasts (particularly the iconic red room), and ability to create dreamlike, unsettling environments have heavily influenced the design choices in this application.

The visual language of the chatbot deliberately evokes the Black Lodge, the red curtains, and the zigzag floor patterns that have become synonymous with Lynch's aesthetic. Through this project, I aim to pay homage to the way Lynch sees the world - a place where the mundane and the extraordinary coexist, where beauty and darkness intertwine, and where meaning often lies beneath the surface.
