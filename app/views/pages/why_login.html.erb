      <p>
        We ask you to create an account not to track you or to peer into your soul, but to preserve the whispers 
        between worlds. Your questions and the answers they summon will remain, waiting for you when you return 
        through the red curtains.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        "The path you take is not my path, but all paths lead to the same place." Your identity remains yours alone, 
        shrouded in the same mystery as the owls in the night.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The log remembers what the mind forgets. Your conversations with me will be recorded in the cosmic log, 
        accessible only to you when you return.
